"What's going on?
Could this be my understanding
It's not your fault, I was being too demanding
I must admit it's my pride that made me distant
All because I hoped that you'd be someone different
There's not much to know about you
Fear will always make you blind
But the answer is in clear view
It's amazing what you'll find face to face
I turned away 'cause I thought you were the problem
Tried to forget until I hit the bottom
But when I faced you in my blank confusion
I had to see it was just a mere illusion
It really didn't make sense
Just to leave this unresolved
It's not hard to go the distance
When you finally get involved face to face"

"Hey Bob I'm looking at what Jack was talking about
And it's definitely not a particle that's nearby.
It is a bright object and it's obviously rotating because it's flashing,
It's way out in the distance, certainly rotating in a very rhythmic fashion
Because the flashes come around almost on time.
As we look back at the earth it's up at about 11 o'clock,
About maybe ten or twelve diameters.
I don't know whether that does you any good,
But there's something out there."

"Driving this road down to paradise
Letting the sunlight into my eyes
Our only plan is to improvise
And it's crystal clear
That I don't ever want it to end
If I had my way I would never leave
Keep building these random memories
Turning our days into melodies
But since I can't stay
I'll just keep playing back
These fragments of time
Everywhere I go
These moments will shine
I'll just keep playing back
These fragments of time
Everywhere I go
These moments will shine
Familiar faces I've never seen
Living the gold and the silver dream
Making me feel like I'm seventeen
And it's crystal clear
That I don't ever want it to end
If I had my way I would never leave
Keep building these random memories
Turning our days into melodies
But since I can't stay
I'll just keep playing back
These fragments of time
Everywhere I go
These moments will shine
I'll just keep playing back
These fragments of time
Everywhere I go
These moments will shine"

The force of the beginning

She's up all night for good fun
I'm up all night to get lucky

And it was you
I just wanted you to stay
Me, I just wanted you to stay
Me, I just wanted you to stay
Me, I just wanted you to stay"

"Dream
Beyond dreams
Beyond life
You will find your song
Before sounds to be found
Close your eyes and rise
Higher still endless thrill
To the lend of love beyond love
Come alive and you'll find forever watching you alive
You are the night you are the ocean
You are the light behind the cloud
You are the end and the beginning
A world with time is not allowed
There's no such thing as complication
To find a way we'll lost control
Remember love's our only mission
This is the journey of the soul"
"[Pharrell Williams Vocals]

"Touch, I remember touch
Pictures came with touch
A painter in my mind
Tell me what you see
A tourist in a dream
A visitor it seems
A half-forgotten song
Where do I belong?
Tell me what you see
I need something more
Kiss, suddenly alive
Happiness arrive
Hunger like a storm
How do I begin?
A room within a room
A door behind a door
Touch, where do you lead?
I need something more
Tell me what you see
I need something more
Hold on
If love is the answer you hold
Touch, sweet touch
You've given me too much to feel
Sweet touch
You've almost convinced me I'm real
I need something more"

"When I was fifteen, sixteen when I started really to play the guitar
I definitely wanted to become a musician
It was almost impossible because the dream was so big
I didn't see any chance because I was living in a little town, I was studying.
And when I finally broke away from school and became I musician
I thought ""well I may have a bit of a chance""
Because all I every wanted to do is music but not only play music
But compose music.
At that time, in Germany, in 1969-70, they already had discotheques
So I would take my car and go to a discotheque and sing maybe 30 minutes
I think I had about 7-8 songs. I would partially sleep in the car
Because I didn't want to drive home and that help me for about almost 2 years to survive.
In the beginning, I wanted to do a album with the sound of the 50s,
The sound of the 60s, of the 70s and then have a sound of the future.
And I said: ""Wait a second?
I know the synthesizer, why don't I use the synthesizer
Which is the sound of the future.""
And I didn't have any idea what to do but I knew I needed a click
So we put a click on the 24 track which was then synch to the moog modular.
I knew that it could be a sound of the future
But I didn't realize how much impact it would be.
My name is Giovanni Giorgio, but everybody calls me Giorgio.
You want to free your mind about a concept of harmony and of music being correct,
You can do whatever you want.
So nobody told me what to do, and there was no preconception of what to do."

"[Verse 1]
I didn't want to be the one to forget
I thought of everything I'd never regret
A little time with you is all that I get
That's all we need because it's all we can take
One thing I never see the same when your 'round
I don't believe in himâhis lips on the ground
I wanna take you to that place in the ""Roche""
But no one gives us any time anymore
He ask me once if I'd look in on his dog
You made an offer for it, then you ran off
I got this picture of us kids in my head
And all I hear is the last thing that you said
[Pre Chorus]
""I listened to your problems
Now listen to mine""
I didn't want to anymore, oh oh oh
[Chorus]
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
Some more again
[Verse 2]
It didn't matter what they wanted to see
He thought he saw someone that looked just like me
The summer memory that just never dies
We worked too long and hard to give it no time
He sees right through me, it's so easy with lies
Cracks in the road that I would try and disguise
He runs his scissor at the seem in the wall
He cannot break it down or else he would fall
One thousand lonely stars hiding in the cold
Take it, I don't wanna sing anymore
[Pre Chorus]
""I listened to your problems
Now listen to mine""
I didn't want to anymore, oh oh oh
[Chorus]
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door...
I don't understand, don't get upset
I'm not with you
We're swimming around,
It's all I do, when I'm with you
[Chorus]
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door"
"There are so many things that I don't understand
There's a world within in me that I cannot explain
Many rooms to explore but the doors look the same
I am lost I can't even remember my name
I've been for sometime, looking for someone
I need to know now, please tell me who I am
I've been for sometime, looking for someone
I need to know now, please tell me who I am
There are so many things that I don't understand
There's a world within me that I cannot explain
Many rooms to explore but the doors look the same
(Where are the locks to the key)
I am lost I can't even remember my name
(And I wondered why)
I've been for sometime, looking for someone
I need to know now, please tell me who I am
I've been for sometime, looking for someone
I need to know now, please tell me who I am
I've been for sometime, looking for someone
I need to know now, please tell me who I am
I've been for sometime, looking for someone
I need to know now, please tell me who I am"

Don't wanna close my eyes
And let this night pass me by
Oh let it pass me by
I don't wanna miss a thing
Your love is so amazing, so amazing
If we could spend forever
Live forever, that's alright with me
I don't wanna miss a thing
Your love is so amazing"

"The grid
A digital frontier
I tried to picture clusters of information
As they moved through the computer
What do they look like?
Ships, motorcycles
With the circuits like freeways
I kept dreaming of a world
I thought I'd never see
And then, one day
I got in"

in this dream im dancing right beside you
and it looked like everyone was having fun
the kinda feeling i waited so long
dont stop, move a little closer
as we jam, the rhythm gets stronger
theres nothing wrong with just a little little fun
we were dancing all night long
the time is right to put my arms around you
your feeling right, you wrap your arms around me too
but suddenly i feel the shining sun
before i know it the dream was all gone
ooh i dont know what to do
about this dream and you
i wish this dream comes true
ooh i dont know what to do
about this dream and you
we'll make these dreams come true
why dont you play the game
why dont you play the game"

"What's going on?
Could this be my understanding
It's not your fault, I was being too demanding
I must admit it's my pride that made me distant
All because I hoped that you'd be someone different
There's not much to know about you
Fear will always make you blind
But the answer is in clear view
It's amazing what you'll find face to face
I turned away 'cause I thought you were the problem
Tried to forget until I hit the bottom
But when I faced you in my blank confusion
I had to see it was just a mere illusion
It really didn't make sense
Just to leave this unresolved
It's not hard to go the distance
When you finally get involved face to face"

Too long, can you feel it, too long, oh can you feel it
Too long, can you feel it, too long, oh can you feel it

To get the best of me
Too long, can you feel it, too long, oh can you feel it

She says I'm cold
Only time I'm comfortable kissing is sending X and O's
I send a message back to dispute this fact, but this I know
I hope to find my love, like we used to before dial-up
Whatever happened to our phone sex,
Right now can't think of anything we don't text
I broke her heart on the email,
I'm so cold I'mma just spare y'all the details
I can't even tell y'all what's real, I got an iTouch but I can't feel

Start mackin' on my blackberry,
She got jealous I was tappin' on my black berry
So she didn't keep in touch and I can't tell the difference,
We ain't see each other much
Aside from some late night texts, a couple O's, a few X's
My current feels just like my ex's,
Different characters, same letters
Red light, another message,
Spillin' her heart out, what a mess this is
P.S. this is BS, I can't even spell it out, am I that unaffectionate?

She said it got better and worser
And it's supposed to be vice-versa
I don't know I kinda like this surf stuff
We used to see tears when we hurt stuff
I guess it got faster but colder
We iChat, that's how she comes over
That's better than not seeing her
And I'm so glad I'm serving her like Serena
She can YouTube in the arena
And we close no matter how many miles between us
I told her ""Welcome to the future""

"Don't wanna let you go
I'm staying here by your side
Wish time was standing still
Don't wanna close my eyes
And let this night pass me by
Oh, let it pass me by
I don't wanna miss a thing
Your love is so amazing, so amazing
If we could spend forever
Live forever, that's alright with me
I don't wanna miss a thing
Your love is so amazing
